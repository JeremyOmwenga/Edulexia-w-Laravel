#PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The application is designed to help dyslexic learners grasp new skills in identifying objects from pictures, forming complete sentences from words and performing simple arithmetic operations.

The user experience has been gamified to appeal to young learners, and users earn points for each challenge completed. There is a leaderboard tha shows the learners with the highest scores in each challenge.

The project is yet to be completed: this copy is for demonstration purposes only.
