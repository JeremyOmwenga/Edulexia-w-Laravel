# Edulexia-w-Laravel

Framework Built version of Edulexia

This version of Edulexia is built upon the Laravel framework, with Blade integrated for administrator functions, user registration and logins.

Deependencies installed include ChartJS for data analytics and Vite for bundling CSS and JS files into core code.

The application is designed to help dyslexic learners grasp new skills in identifying objects from pictures, forming complete sentences from words and performing simple arithmetic operations.

The user experience has been gamified to appeal to young learners, and users earn points for each challenge completed. There is a leaderboard tha shows the learners with the highest scores in each challenge.

The project is yet to be completed: this copy is for demonstration purposes only.
